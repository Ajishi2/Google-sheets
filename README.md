Google Sheets Clone - Web Application
Overview
This project is a web application that mimics the core functionalities and user interface of Google Sheets. It includes features such as a spreadsheet interface, mathematical and data quality functions, data entry and validation, and basic data visualization capabilities.

Features
1. Spreadsheet Interface
Mimic Google Sheets UI: The application closely resembles Google Sheets, including the toolbar, formula bar, and cell structure.

Drag Functions: Implement drag functionality for cell content, formulas, and selections.

Cell Dependencies: Formulas and functions accurately reflect cell dependencies and update accordingly when changes are made to related cells.

Basic Cell Formatting: Support for bold, italics, font size, and color.

Row and Column Management: Ability to add, delete, and resize rows and columns.

2. Mathematical Functions
SUM: Calculates the sum of a range of cells.

AVERAGE: Calculates the average of a range of cells.

MAX: Returns the maximum value from a range of cells.

MIN: Returns the minimum value from a range of cells.

COUNT: Counts the number of cells containing numerical values in a range.

3. Data Quality Functions
TRIM: Removes leading and trailing whitespace from a cell.

UPPER: Converts the text in a cell to uppercase.

LOWER: Converts the text in a cell to lowercase.

REMOVE_DUPLICATES: Removes duplicate rows from a selected range.

FIND_AND_REPLACE: Allows users to find and replace specific text within a range of cells.

4. Data Entry and Validation
Data Types: Allow users to input various data types (numbers, text, dates).

Data Validation: Implement basic data validation checks (e.g., ensuring numeric cells only contain numbers).

Data Visualization: Incorporate data visualization capabilities (e.g., charts, graphs).

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

Usage
Entering Data: Click on any cell to start entering data.

Formulas: Start with an equals sign (=) to enter a formula (e.g., =SUM(A1:A10)).

Formatting: Use the toolbar to format cells (bold, italics, font size, color).

Drag and Drop: Drag the corner of a cell to copy its content or formula to adjacent cells.

Data Validation: Ensure data integrity by setting validation rules for cells.

Data Visualization: Select a range of data and use the toolbar to create charts and graphs.
